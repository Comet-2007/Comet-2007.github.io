### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 1 was my favorite because we were able to spell check words on any file by checking it with a dictionary. Another feature I thought that was cool is that it returned the misspelled word back to you. I found it interesting and cool that this is one way they can use spellcheck.
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 2 was another one of my favorites since I kinda learned how to play blackjack from it. I was curious about how to play and how the games work and thanks to this lab I figured out both. This was definitely one of the more fun labs we have done.
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 1 was also another favorite of mine. I thought the lab was fun and interesting compared to most of the other labs. I found the idea cool that you can put any protein, bread type, and add on for your sandwich and it spit it out as a whole sentence. Overall definitely one of the better labs we have done.
